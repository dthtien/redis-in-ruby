# Welcome!

This website is a completely free, ongoing, "book" about attempting to rewrite Redis in Ruby.

Start reading the first [chapter below](#posts), or head to the [chapters list](/chapters/)

## Who is this for?

This online book is aimed at people with some programming experience. I am assuming a reasonable level of familiarity
with programming concepts such as conditions, loops, classes as well as some understanding of networking. Readers should
already have heard of protocols such as [HTTP][http] and [TCP][tcp] and I think it would help to have already worked with those.
Anyone who worked with a web application, regardless of the language, should have enough experience to read this book.

I wrote this book aiming for it to be useful to five years ago me, when I had about 2 and 3 years of professional
experience. I majored in computer science, so back then I had already a fair amount of few years of experience with
programming. That being said, a degree in CS is definitely not required to read this.

On a spectrum from beginner to expert, I would say that it aims somwhere in the middle, but leaning towards beginner,
slightly on the left, so intermediate-ish.
